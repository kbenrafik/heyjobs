Exercise

Build a simple mock up of a React web app which displays job postings. There

should be two pages:

1) Jobs List Page

Displays a list of available jobs. Each job should have a link to its job detail page​.

2) Job Detail Page

Displays all the information about an individual job that an applicant requires to

decide if they want to apply.

Some implementation points

● Please put the code in a public repository on your github profile, and provide us

with a link. After a fresh git clone, the app should install, build and run by running

‘npm start​’ in the project’s root directory. It should then be accessible on

http://localhost:3333

● At HeyJobs we use redux, redux-promise-middleware/redux-thunk, react-router,

styled-components, material-ui, webpack. It will help put the exercise into the

context of the work we do here if you stick mostly to these libraries.

● Use a node.js server to serve your app and the jobs data. Just serve hard-coded

dummy job data.

● For job images, we encourage you to use a placeholder service like

www.placekitten.com. Don’t spend time curating images!

● SEO is important for job postings. The app should be able to be server rendered.

The purpose of this exercise is to get an idea of how you build React applications, as

a starting point for a conversation in any subsequent interviews.

It is strictly a mock up. Keep it simple. Don’t spend time on overly complex UI, any

additional features not defined above, or any polish in general!
